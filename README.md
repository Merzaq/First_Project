# First_Project:
Four years ago I discovered GitHub since then I used it without creating a project in it.This last month I worked on django python and I discovered a lot of interesting projects that I tested on my machine.
The last, from django packages: https://djangopackages.org/ : RELATE (Environment for Learning And TEaching).
I encountered a problem creating a course in the platform.
